                        our Privacy Policy, and any other policies we might invent later when we realize we 
                        forgot something important. If you do not agree with these terms, please refrain from 
                        purchasing, viewing, or forming emotional attachments to anything offered here.</p>

                        pretending not to notice your shopping habits. By continuing, you confirm that you 
                        possess the legal and emotional maturity to handle both financial transactions and 
                        the consequences of your decisions.</p>

                    <p>All products listed on this site are subject to availability, whim, and occasional 
                        mysterious disappearance. Descriptions are provided for your convenience, accuracy 
                        not guaranteed. Images are for illustrative purposes only and may differ slightly 
                        from the item you receive—particularly in temperament, personality, and willingness 
                        to cooperate.</p>

                        forms of payment, including digital, emotional, and possibly karmic. By submitting 
                        payment, you agree that you are not under the influence of hypnosis, peer pressure, 
                        or caffeine-induced impulsivity.</p>

                        reliability, or weather-related phenomena. We are not responsible for delays caused 
                        by acts of nature, existential crises, or spontaneous dimension rifts.</p>

                    <p>6. Returns and Refunds</p>
                    <p>All sales are final unless explicitly stated otherwise or approved through a process 
                        so complicated that you'll probably give up halfway through. Returns are accepted only 
                        in cases of severe dissatisfaction, ethical emergencies, or if the item starts talking 
                        back. Refunds will be processed at the speed of bureaucratic light.</p>

                        explanations to your significant other. This includes, but is not limited to: creating 
                        multiple accounts to argue with yourself, attempting to access restricted content through 
                        interpretive dance, or using our logo to start a cult. You are solely responsible for 
                        maintaining the confidentiality of your password, your identity, and any irrational attachments

                        encryption, or at least a strong sense of moral obligation. Your information may be shared with
